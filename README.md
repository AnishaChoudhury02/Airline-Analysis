For this project, I use SQL and Python to identify opportunities to increase occupancy rate on low performing flights which can ultimately lead to increased profitablity. The full report and the codes are also published.

# Business Problem:
A hypothetical company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines.They have been providing high-quality air transportation services to their clients for several years, with primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. However, they are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue.To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.
# 3 MAIN OBJECTIVES:
1. Increase occupancy rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, they can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.
2. Improve pricing strategy: The company needs to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
3. Enhance customer experience: They need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.

# Basic Analysis
The basic analysis of data provides insights into the # of planes with more than 100 seats, how the number of tickets booked, total amount earned changed over time, and the average fare for each aircraft with different fare conditions.These findings will be useful in developing strategies to increase occupancy rates and optimize pricing for each aircraft. These findings will be useful in developing strategies to increase occupancy rates and optimize pricing for each aircraft
# Analyzing Occupancy Rate
Airlines must thoroughly analyze their revenue streams in order to maximize profitability. The overall income per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft are important metrics to consider. Airlines may use this information to determine which aircraft types and itineraries generate the most income and alter their operations appropriately.This research can also assist in identifying potential for pricing optimization and allocating resources to more profitable routes.
## Occupancy rate:
The average occupancy per aircraft is another critical number to consider. Airlines may measure how successfully they fill their seats and discover chances to boost occupancy rates by using this metric. Higher occupancy rates can help airlines increase revenue and profitability while lowering operational expenses associated with vacant seats. Pricing strategy, airline schedules, and customer satisfaction are all factors that might influence occupancy rates
# Strategy
Lastly, we look at how a higher occupancy rate would impact the industry. Airlines can assess how much their total yearly turnover could improve by providing all aircraft a 10% higher occupancy rate to further examine the possible benefits of raising occupancy rates. This research can assist airlines in determining the financial impact of boosting occupancy rates and if it is a realistic strategy. Airlines may enhance occupancy rates and revenue while delivering greater value and service to consumers by optimizing pricing tactics and other operational considerations
# Conclusion
To summarize, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is critical for airlines seeking to maximize profitability. Airlines can find areas for improvement and modify their pricing and route plans as a result of assessing these indicators. A greater occupancy rate is one important feature that can enhance profitability since it allows airlines to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with vacant seats.The airline should revise the price for each aircraft as the lower price and high price is also the factor that people are not buying tickets from those aircrafts.They should decide the reasonable price according to the condition and facility of the aircraft and it should not be very cheap or high. Furthermore, boosting occupancy rates should not come at the price of consumer happiness or safety. Airlines must strike a balance between the necessity for profit and the significance of delivering highquality service and upholding safety regulations. Airlines may achieve long-term success in a highly competitive business by adopting a data-driven strategy to revenue analysis and optimisation.
